Example code for determination of all ground states in a cluster expansion model.
The example shown here is for a 2D hexagonal bicrystal lattice, with nearest-neighbour interactions.

The python script depends on the Gurobi MIP solver http://gurobi.com/ (free for academic use), numpy and scipy.
The code is tested on python 3.5.2.
